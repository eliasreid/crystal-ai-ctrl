# crystal-ai-ctrl

WIP

Plugin for BizHawk's GBHawk emulator for control the opponent trainer's actions.

Interfaces with this webserver and browser client (https://github.com/eliasreid/pokemon-enemy-ctrl-web) to allow remote control of enemy trainers.

## Usage
See BizHawk ext tools wiki for instructions on how to build and run an external tool: https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk-ExternalTools/wiki

Currently interface with web server / browser doesn't work, but the tools does work to control enemy actions.

Instructions for pre-built release TBD when in working state
